Note-keeping and random thought section of [[justin.vc|https://www.justin.vc]]. Generally follows a wiki-esque format of notes that are pretty self explanatory, see the links below for more details. Used the structure of [[Soren Bjornstad's Zettelkasten|https://zettelkasten.sorenbjornstad.com#]] as a base after reading his book on TiddlyWiki. <<fnote "Which is really good, recommend if new to TW (https://groktiddlywiki.com/)">> The idea would be to keep limited notes here, with [[sources|Source]], then utilize [[fastpages|https://fp.justin.vc]] as the [[sink|Sink]]. I play fast-and-loose with the "cards must be small" ideology, for sake of simplicity, books and notes will be congealed, and if deemed important enough, will be broken into smaller topics.
